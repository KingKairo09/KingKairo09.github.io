    <div class="section">
      <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?</h2>
      <p>
      I think human skills offers alot of insight into how people think, feel and act. I can distinctly remember learning about Emotional Intellegence (EQ) vs Interlectual Intellegence (IQ) and how i could correlate the learnings and techniques into my own life, It felt increadibly empowering.
      </p>
        <h3>The 3 new things i have learnt about myself ego. </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>1. Self believe. I have learned in life you are your biggest advocate and you need to be proud to progress.</li>
          <li>2. Humility. As important as being proud is. one must also remember to be humble and respectful of others.</li>
          <li>3. Faith. Having faith doen;t just mean believing in yourself or others! it's about having confidence in yourself and what you believe. </li>

      </ul>

      <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>

      <div class="section">
          <h3>Values:</h3>
          <p>Values form the foundation of how we approach learning and work. In programming, values such as curiosity, integrity, perseverance, and collaboration guide behaviors and decision-making.</p>
          <h3>Empathy:</h3>
          <p>Empathy allows programmers and learners to understand the needs and perspectives of users, colleagues, and stakeholders.</p>
          <h3>Self-Awareness:</h3>
          <p>Self-awareness is vital for personal growth, adaptability, and continuous learning.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Why is EQ Important and How is it Relevant to You?</h2>
        <h3>Importance of EQ:</h3>
        <p>Not having EQ can lead to feeling misunderstood by others or lacking the ability to understand people. This can result in negative feelings about yourself and others. Without EQ, it's harder to make friends, work with others, or even understand yourself. High EQ is essential for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Building strong relationships</li>
            <li>Managing stress and emotions</li>
            <li>Communicating effectively</li>
            <li>Empathizing with others</li>
            <li>Overcoming challenges and resolving conflicts</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Relevance to You:</h3>
        <p>For me, developing EQ is important becuase i want to understand how i think and feel at all times so that i can use my own awareness to understand how other poeple think and feel. It's all about connection and this is just a tool to help me connect with you.</p>
