        <h2>
          What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego
          due to the Human Skills learning?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I think Human Skills offers a lot of insight into how people think,
          feel, and act. I distinctly remember learning about Emotional
          Intelligence (EQ) vs Intellectual Intelligence (IQ) and how I could
          correlate the learnings and techniques into my own life. It felt
          incredibly empowering.
        </p>
        <h3>The 3 new things I have learned about my ego:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            1. Self-belief. I have learned in life that you are your biggest
            advocate, and you need to be proud to progress.
          </li>
          <li>
            2. Humility. As important as being proud is, one must also remember
            to be humble and respectful of others.
          </li>
          <li>
            3. Faith. Having faith doesnâ€™t just mean believing in yourself or
            others; it's about having confidence in yourself and what you
            believe in.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>
          What are the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming?
        </h2>

        <div class="section">
          <h3>Values:</h3>
          <p>
            Values form the foundation of how we approach learning and work. In
            programming, values such as curiosity, integrity, perseverance, and
            collaboration guide behaviors and decision-making.
          </p>
          <h3>Empathy:</h3>
          <p>
            Empathy allows programmers and learners to understand the needs and
            perspectives of users, colleagues, and stakeholders.
          </p>
          <h3>Self-Awareness:</h3>
          <p>
            Self-awareness is vital for personal growth, adaptability, and
            continuous learning.
          </p>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>
            What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?
          </h2>
          <h3>Realization</h3>
          <p>
            I think what really surprised me about learning Human Skills is how
            enlightened I became after realizing how something works, how people
            think, or how to better communicate with others.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>
            What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
          </h2>
          <h3>Consistency</h3>
          <p>
            I have realized the importance of reflecting and journaling when
            experiencing new things or creating significant memories, but being
            consistent with journaling and reflecting can often feel like a
            chore.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>
            Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
            focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development bootcamp
            course?
          </h2>
          <h3>The Importance of Human Skills Learning</h3>
          <p>
            I think it's important for people to be self-aware, and I believe
            Human Skills is the tool for learning to be more self-aware and
            self-conscious. These are practical life skills that everyday,
            ordinary people need to incorporate.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>
            Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel
            like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to
            practice programming instead? Justify your answer.
          </h2>
          <h3>Human Skills Learning Justified!</h3>
          <p>
            Human Skills learning is crucial for everyday life. We need to learn
            these very important skills to function and operate in the world and
            when interacting with other human beings. It is a necessary skill to
            know.
