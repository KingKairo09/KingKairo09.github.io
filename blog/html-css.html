    <h1>So you wanna know what's good in the hood with classes vs IDs</h1>

    <div class="blogPost">
      <p>
        When creating Classes and IDs there are multiple things to take into
        account, such as: styalising and designing HTML documents, following the
        best practices when creating them and maintaining clean/clear code.
      </p>

      <h2>Classes vs IDs: The key differences</h2>
      <p><strong>CLasses:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Classes can be used multiple times on the same page.</li>
        <li>Classes are Ideal for styling groups of elements.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>IDs:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>IDs must be unique within a page.</li>
        <li>IDs are usually used for a single element.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What are the Best Practices?</h2>
      <p><strong>1. IDs are best used for Unique Elements</strong></p>
      <p>
        IDs are best for single elements that need to be uniquely identified,
        such as a unique navigation bar, a specific section, or when you need to
        modify the element directly with JavaScript.
      </p>

      <p><strong>2. Classes are for Reusable Styles</strong></p>
      <p>
        Classes should be used for styling multiple elements that share the same
        styling rules, such as buttons, form fields, or repeated sections.
      </p>

      <p><strong>3. Try not to Overuse IDs</strong></p>
      <p>
        Overusing IDs can lead to issues in CSS, making it harder to override
        styles and read the code. Classes on the other hand can be reused and
        are much more flexible in this regard.
      </p>

      <p><strong>4. Be specific</strong></p>
      <p>
        IDs are more specific than classes. If you need to make changes to a
        style, using a class will generally be easier and more manageable.
      </p>

      <p><strong>5. Use simple naming conventions</strong></p>
      <p>
        Clear, easy and understandable names make your HTML and CSS come much
        easier to read and maintain.
      </p>

      <p><strong>6. Try to avoid using Inline Styles</strong></p>
      <p>
        Inline styles (e.g., <code>style="color: red;"</code>) need to be
        specific and can make your code harder to read and understand. Use
        classes and IDs in your CSS files instead.
      </p>

      <p><strong>7. Use IDs for Javascript</strong></p>
      <p>
        IDs are useful for selecting elements in JavaScript because they are
        unique and provide a direct way to manipulate specific elements.
      </p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        By following these best practices, you can ensure your code is clean,
        easy to understand, easy to maintain, and scalable for future use.
        Understanding when to use classes versus IDs is a fundamental skill in
        web development that will help you create better and Truely epic web
        pages.
