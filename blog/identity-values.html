          <h2>Ethical Decision-Making</h2>
          <p>
            Two years ago, I received a call from Oranga Tamariki seeking help
            to house my 16-year-old nephew, a troubled youth with many negative
            encounters. Living with my dad at the time, I saw it as an
            opportunity for us to support my nephew together. I accepted the
            request to re-home him with us. My nephew is dead now, he died
            earlier this year. I think back to that moment when I got that call
            and I'm so glad I accepted the request to help my nephew. It was a
            blessing getting to know him even though his life was short lived he
            will always be a part of my story.

          <h2>Cultural Influence on Values and Identity</h2>

          <p>
            Raised by a strong mother who valued culture and traditions, I
            developed a passionate love for my culture, people, and identity.
            These elements shape my life and influence my actions. I am
            committed to protecting and honoring them for as long as I live.

          <h2>Evaluating Limitations</h2>
          <p>
            Procrastination is my worst enemy. Losing interest in tasks leads to
            a loss of focus and a vicious cycle of procrastination. However, I
            am learning to control this and to stay on track with my goals.

          <h2>Working Productively with Others</h2>
          <p>
            I can’t think of any examples where conflict, tension was avoided
            but I can think of a few times where I lost my cool lol. I suppose
            the best thing for me to do is remain in control of my temper and
            keep my cool head on my shoulders.
