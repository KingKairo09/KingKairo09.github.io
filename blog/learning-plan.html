          <h2>Long-Term Goal or Career Pathway</h2>
          <p>
            My long-term goal/career pathway is simply this: I want to invent a
            website that protects, connects, and saves my people, culture, and
            traditions.

          <h2>Strengths and Limitations in Learning</h2>
          <h3>Strengths</h3>
          <p>
            A strength of mine that I pride myself on is my ability to teach
            myself anything! Whether that be a new skill or an unfamiliar
            technique, I have the ability, patience, and focus required to learn
            and implement anything I teach myself.
          </p>
          <h3>Limitations</h3>
          <p>
            A limitation of mine is that I am a slow learner but a thorough one.
            I often need time to think and understand what I am learning before
            I can apply it.
          </p>

          <h2>Skills to Develop at Dev Academy</h2>
          <p>
            I would like to learn how to better manage myself and my time. I
            often lose interest in what I need to do, which leads me to
            procrastinate and avoid completing it.
          </p>

          <h2>Managing Workload in the Programme</h2>
          <h3>Productive and Safe Collaboration</h3>
          <p>
            I am committed to completing this programme because it is vital to
            my long-term goal. I am committed to coming into campus 3-4 days a
            week to allow myself to separate my home life and work life so that
            I can focus and work effectively in a more appropriate environment.
          </p>
          <h3>Handling Stress</h3>
          <p>
            When things start to build up or get to me, I will "bite the bullet"
            and work hard. I will take responsibility for my lack of work and
            strive to work harder. I will get on my own case!
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>Seeking Help</h2>
          <p>
            I will communicate with my facilitators if I need help. I will be
            open and honest with them and take in any advice they are willing to
            share with me.
          </p>

          <h2>Expectations from the Facilitation Team</h2>
          <p>I expect them to be open and honest with me!</p>

        <section>
          <h2>Scheduling and Commitments</h2>
          <p>
            I have commitments to Maurakau (Māori Martial Arts) and Muay Thai
            (Martial Arts) outside of this course.
