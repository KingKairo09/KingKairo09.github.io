    <h1>Problem Solving and Understanding what to do.</h1>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>What's your problem my bro?</h2>
      <h3>Explain yo-self !PROBLEM!:</h3>
      <p>
        I've encountered many problems; Like where do i even start?... Let's start on the most recent techinical problem in our most recent exercise challenge "Javascript Kata"
        I'll take the FlipFlop test for example:
        I didnt't even understand what the test was asking me to do initially; It was all so confusing and a little frustrating because every challenge is diffirent so it's almost like having to start new everytime.
        What i do? I resorted to me trusty good mate "Matua ChatGPT" who broke down the test and explained in detailed how i was supposed to solve it.
      </p>
        <h3>FlipFlop not FlipFLopping:</h3>
        <p>
          I encourtered a problem when trying to solve the FlipFlop test. I couldn't understand why i kept getting a 'SyntaxError' when i would run 'npm test' so i asked Matua ChatGPT.
          He explained to me that the Identifier 'flipflop' had already been decleared and that i needed to check my code for 'flipflop' being imported or decleared multiple times.
          (WHUUUUUU sounds smart when i read that out loud!)
        </p>
        <ul>
          <h4> What is the process to solve the problem?</h4>
          <li>Step.1 - Accept you are a potatoe who knows nothing!</li>
          <li>Step.2 - Look at the task/challenge/test and try to figure it out without Matua ChatGPT if possible.</li>
          <li>Step.3 - Accept you are a potatoe who knows nothing about coding!.</li>
          <li>Step.4 - !THE SAUCE! when you get to this point and there is no other solution go ahead and ask matua ChatGPT for a hand. He's always there to help.</li>
          <li>Step.5 - Congradulations: You are less of a potatoe and more of kumara now!!! Problem solved. </li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Helpful Problem Solving Techniques:</h1>

      <div class="section">
          <ul>
            <h2>
              These are some helpful Techniques to incorporate when trying to problem solve.
            </h2>
            <li>Pseudocode</li>
            <li>Trying Something Diffirent or New</li>
            <li>Reading error messages and trying to understand them.</li>
            <li>Whaea Google</li>
            <li>Matua ChatGPT</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I often find writing Pseudocode is helpful to me when i don't exactly know what the code is doing. It's kinda like a reminder that tells me what function a specific line of code will do.
            It's a great way to learn new problem solving techniques as well.
            Reading error messages is also handy when you can't figure out a solution. It can be easily broken down and understood with matua ChatGPT's help of course.

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Reflect: When i needed more help what did i do?</h2>
        <p>When i'm feeling super duper stuck on a problem. I do what we as humans are supposed to do and speak to other human beings for guidance, inspiration or support.
          Sometimes; The problems we are facing are not techical but are emotional or mental so speaking to someone or confiding with friends and whanau can be the best solution to solve many problems. 
          I think of a time where my facilitator told me "GET ON YOUR OWN CASE" which made me think critically about all my life problems and how i can solve them. which intern helped me to solve my technical problems as well.
